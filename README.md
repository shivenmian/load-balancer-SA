# load-balancer-SA
An analysis of the efficiency of load balancing algorithms on MEAN stack webapps

## Getting Started

**Before you start working**, it is imperative you know all that's written in [this doc](/GETTING_STARTED.md) so please go over it before doing anything else.

## Workflow (follow this strictly)

We'll be submitting Pull Requests (PRs) for features. To do so:

1. ```cd``` to your local folder (i.e the one you cloned).
2. Checkout to another branch where you're gonna work. **Don't work on master. Always checkout to another branch for everything you work on**. 

  ```git checkout -b branchname```

  You can check your current branch by doing ```git branch```. The branch name with a star (\*) is your current branch.

3. Once you're on another branch, you can add in your code and work.

4. When you're done working, push your code.

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "commit message"
  git push origin master
  ```

5. Go to https://github.com/shivenmian/load-balancer-SA while logged into your account. If you have pushed correctly, you'll see a message "You recently pushed branches. Create Pull Request". Create the pull request.

6. If your pull request gets merged, go to the Parent Issue [#2](https://github.com/shivenmian/load-balancer-SA/issues/2) and tick the box.
